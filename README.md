# securepaycodingchallenge
This repository is created as part of the securepay coding challenge

The project is created in a POM design pattern with Maven as a build tool, Selenium WebDriver automation library, Java programming language and with Cucumber as BDD tool


BDD Implementation
Feature file is created which explains the Scenario and the steps performed for this test in Gherkin format
Step Definition file has the code for calling the methods that implement the required steps for performing the test
Test Runner file is the runner file which has references to the feature file and the step definition and is used to run the project

pom.xml

Has all the dependencies,build,plugin and properties that are required to build and run the project

Page Objects

Each webpage has a class created with the members(locators) and the member methods that are implemented for that page

GooglePage
GoogleSearchResultsPage
SecurePayHomePage
SecurePayContactUsPage

WebDriverManager dependency is added to pom.xml that helps in executing the tests without fail by eliminating the risk of tests failing because of the change in browser version and incompatible browser driver versions

Test Data

Test Data to fill the Contact Us form is generated using the java library - Java Faker

Configuration Properties

Property file is created for the data like application url and wait times that are used in different modules within the project

Utilities

ConfigFileReader helps to represent and read the property list and for access of properties file in different modules within the project

Execution

Project can be run as a maven test or running the TestRunner file via IDE
From command prompt, the project can be run using the maven command - mvn clean test

Reporting

The maven dependency to create HTML Cucumber Reports is added to pom.xml.
HTML reports can be generated by running the below commands and the HTML report will be generated under target/cucumber-report-html --> 
mvn clean test
mvn verify -DskipTests
